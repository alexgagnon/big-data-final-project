\section{Introduction}
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM

The domain of Question-Answering boils down to an inconsistency between the unstructured natural language based question and the structured schema of the knowledge base that contains the answer. When a question is asked in human language, a processing step must convert its semantics into a formal query suitable to be run against a datastore such as DBpedia, Freebase, and Wikidata. The information in these stores is represented by a graph containing facts in the form of subject/predicate/object triples, known as RDF (e.g. ''(Michal Jordan, born in, Brooklyn NY)''). The primary mechanism for accessing these knowledge graphs is through specialized query languages (e.g. SPARQL), that traverse the graph and retrieve triples matching the request. A failure to convert the question into the appropriate formal query can lead to errors, and the likelihood of an mistaken conversion increases as the question becomes more complex. This can happen either through the question being composed of multiple clauses, or due to thena
